# Retinal-OCT-Image-Classification-Adversarial-Attacks-and-Defense-Strategies


The core objective of this project is to comprehend the vulnerabilities within Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and implement strategies to bolster their resilience against adversarial threats. This project will particularly focus on adversarial attacks and defense strategies for image classification CNNs, with a special emphasis on retinal OCT image classification. Retinal OCT images are critical in the medical field for diagnosing and monitoring various eye conditions, making the robustness of these classification models paramount to ensure reliable and accurate medical diagnoses.

To achieve comprehensive results, this project will leverage a dataset of retinal OCT images, encompassing a wide range of conditions and classifications. The robustness of the CNN model will be
challenged through a variety of adversarial attacks, including but not limited to Copycat, KnockOffNets, Fast Gradient Sign Method, and DeepFool. The impact of these adversarial attacks on the model's performance will be meticulously assessed by analyzing the reduction in classification accuracy and the increase in loss values across different adversarial scenarios.

To enhance the model's resilience against such attacks, several defense mechanisms will be implemented. These strategies will include reinforcing class labels to create stronger, more accurate classification
boundaries. Additionally, the introduction of Gaussian noise to the input images will be explored as a method to obscure adversarial perturbations and improve the model's stability. The outcome of this project will significantly deepen our understanding of the adversarial vulnerabilities present in CNN models, particularly in the context of retinal OCT image classification. The findings will underscore the critical need for robust defense mechanisms to protect these models from adversarial threats, ensuring their reliability and effectiveness in real-world applications.
